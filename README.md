Inventory App
Overview

This mobile application was developed as an inventory management tool to help users securely log in, view, and manage items in a warehouse. The app’s primary goal was to provide an efficient, user-friendly way to track stock levels while also notifying users when an item’s quantity reaches zero.

Requirements and Goals

The app was designed to address user needs such as:

Secure login and account creation for new users

A clear, grid-based display of all inventory items

The ability to add and remove items

The ability to increase or decrease the quantity of a specific item

Notifications when item quantities reach zero

User-Centered UI Design

To support these requirements, the app included a login screen, an inventory grid display, and controls for managing item quantities. The design emphasized simplicity, clarity, and usability. Buttons were labeled intuitively, layouts were organized for quick navigation, and the interface was kept clean to reduce user frustration. This focus on usability ensured the UI was approachable and successful in supporting user needs.

Development Approach

I approached coding the app by breaking down development into smaller, manageable tasks and testing each feature incrementally. Modular coding helped keep related logic grouped together, while consistent documentation ensured I stayed organized. This structured approach is one I can apply to future projects to handle increasingly complex requirements.

Testing

Testing was carried out at both the feature level and the full-application level. Each individual feature (such as login authentication, item addition, and quantity adjustment) was tested separately before the entire app was tested as a whole. This process revealed small issues early and ensured stability across all features. Testing was critical for identifying errors that could have disrupted functionality and for ensuring a smooth user experience.

Innovation and Problem-Solving

During development, I had to innovate to handle challenges such as managing the database for inventory updates and designing a UI that balanced simplicity with functionality. Overcoming these required experimenting with different approaches, refining my logic, and adjusting the interface to align with user expectations.

Demonstrated Strengths

A particularly successful component of this app was the inventory adjustment system. Implementing functionality for adding, removing, and updating quantities seamlessly showcased my technical ability to combine coding logic with UI design while maintaining a user-centered approach. This part of the project highlights my growing knowledge, skills, and experience in mobile app development.
